## Key Features## Key Features

- **Data Analysis and Cleaning:**
  - Cleaned and analyzed diverse datasets, including COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination data.
  - Explored the structure and content of each dataset.

- **Visualization:**
  - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visually impactful charts and graphs.
  - Generated bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to visualize COVID-19 trends, vaccination rates, and the relationship between variables.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Implemented a linear regression model to explore the relationship between GDP per capita and COVID-19 cases.
  - Calculated correlation coefficients to identify countries with similar trends in daily new cases.

- **Geographical and Temporal Analysis:**
